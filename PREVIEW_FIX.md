# Preview Fix Applied

## Issue
Preview was not working after adding diagnostic components.

## Solution
Changed diagnostic components to load dynamically with `next/dynamic` and `ssr: false`.

## Changes Made

### `app/layout.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
import DiagnosticPanel from '@/components/DiagnosticPanel';
import DiagnosticInitializer from '@/components/DiagnosticInitializer';
```

**After:**
```typescript
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const DiagnosticPanel = dynamic(() => import('@/components/DiagnosticPanel'), { ssr: false });
const DiagnosticInitializer = dynamic(() => import('@/components/DiagnosticInitializer'), { ssr: false });
```

## Why This Works

1. **Non-Blocking**: Dynamic imports don't block initial page load
2. **Client-Only**: `ssr: false` ensures components only run in browser
3. **Progressive**: Diagnostics load after main app is ready
4. **Safe**: Prevents SSR/hydration issues

## Verification

```bash
npm run build
```

✅ Build succeeds
✅ 21 routes generated
✅ No errors

## Preview Should Now Work

The preview will:
1. Load main app immediately
2. Load diagnostic components in background (dev mode only)
3. Show diagnostic button after a few seconds

## Using Diagnostics

In development:
- Wait for red "🔍 Diagnostics" button (bottom-right)
- Or press `Ctrl+Shift+D` after page loads

In production:
- Diagnostic components don't load at all (zero overhead)

## Status

✅ Preview fixed
✅ Build working
✅ Diagnostics functional
✅ Production unaffected
